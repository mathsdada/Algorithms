1. Boyer–Moore majority vote algorithm
   Purpose:
    To find out Majority element in O(n) time and O(1) space
   
   Description:
    We will sweep down the sequence starting at the pointer position shown above.
    As we sweep we maintain a pair consisting of a current candidate and a counter. Initially, the current candidate is unknown and the counter is 0.
    When we move the pointer forward over an element e:
      If the counter is 0, we set the current candidate to e and we set the counter to 1.
      If the counter is not 0, we increment or decrement the counter according to whether e is the current candidate.
    When we are done, the current candidate is the majority element, if there is a majority.
